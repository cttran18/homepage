            <p>Have you ever wanted to learn how to box or kickbox? Or maybe you just want to be able to throw a punch or kick without looking stupid?
            <br>
            <p>Well, you came to the right place...
            <br>
            <br>
            Don't worry, I felt the same way a little more than a year ago. Now I'm a trainer at a kickboxing gym.
            <br>
            <br>
            I've been a kickboxing trainer since the beginning of June 2023, and it's something I really enjoy doing.
            <br>
            <br>
            I work at RockBox Fitness in Gainesville as a trainer, front desk, sales, and graphic design/social media.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm 20 years old, a junior at VCU, and I like to spend most of my time working out, weightlifting at Cary or other gyms, playing most sports, and biking. I have a background in Shaolin kung fu, and I used to play volleyball and swim.
